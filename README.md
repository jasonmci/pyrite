Python and Playwright

![example workflow](https://github.com/jasonmci/pyrite/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)

Out of the gate Python is managed with pyenv
Upgraded playwright to the latest version and installed it

## Github actions for this project



## Pytest watch mode
One of my favorite things about automated test is in watch mode

https://johnfraney.ca/blog/pytest-watched-failed-tests/

The fastest way to focus on the testing that needs to be written

```
ptw -- --last-failed --new-first
```

Where the -- separator denotes where pytest-watch args stop and pytest arguments start.
